Only the primary sources are version-controlled (to ease maintenance),
therefore you will have to get the latest stable versions of the
maintainer tools we depend upon, including:

- Automake <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>
- Autoconf <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>
- Gzip <http://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/>
- Tar <http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/>

As of this writing, the latest stable version of Gzip is 1.2.4 but we
suggest using test version 1.3.5 (or later, if one becomes available).

The next step is to run the developer tools to create e.g.,
the autoconf-based configure script:

        $ aclocal
        $ automake
        $ autoconf

And there you are!  Just

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make check
