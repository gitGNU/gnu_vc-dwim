2006-09-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* vc-dwim.pl (exists_editor_backup): Recognize Vim temporaries, too.

2006-09-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* vc-dwim.pl: Update comments.
	(usage): Calling parse_from_filehandle with *DATA doesn't
	work after all.  Revert that part of the 2006-09-05 change.
	(get_diffs): Remove some useless trailing spaces from unidiff output.
	(main): Handle unidiff output that may now include empty lines.

	* configure.ac: Version 0.1.3.

	Work even when run from a subdir with git or hg.
	* VC.pm (full_file_name, diff_outputs_full_file_names): New methods.
	(new): Record depth of "." relative to "top" level directory, when
	using a VC like hg or git.
	* vc-dwim.pl (main): When checking whether each affected file
	is listed in the "diff" output, look up full name, if necessary,
	i.e., for hg or git.
	* tests/subdir: Adapt test, now that this finally works.
	* tests/Makefile.am (XFAIL_TESTS): Remove, now that this test
	no longer fails.

2006-09-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* VC.pm: New file.  Factored out of...
	* vc-dwim.pl: ...here.
	* Makefile.am (dist_perllib_DATA): Add VC.pm.

2006-09-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* configure.ac: Version 0.1.3-pre.
	* configure.ac: Version 0.1.2.

	Performance tweak.  Probably not worthwhile, seeing as how it's
	not based on profiling, but for a command like "./vc-dwim --diff",
	it does avoid loading the module.
	* vc-dwim.pl (main): "use" Tie::IxHash only if we'll need it.

	* vc-dwim.pl: Remove now-unnecessary "use dir ...".

	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add cl-but-no-diff and subdir-cvs.
	* tests/subdir-cvs: New file.

2006-09-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* vc-dwim.pl (verbose_cmd): Quote meta-characters.

	* vc-dwim.pl (usage): Remove now-duplicated/redundant --help text.
	Instead, generate nearly the same output using Pod::PlainText.
	(usage): Use *DATA directly, suggestion from Ed Santiago.
	Remove now-unused local.

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Prepend ".", so that we're sure to build
	in this directory, updating vc-dwim if needed, before running tests.

	Better parsing.
	* vc-dwim.pl (change_log_line_extract_file_list): Move this function
	"up", to precede new use...
	(find_relevant_file_name): ...here, rather than requiring a more
	limited syntax.
	* tests/cl-but-no-diff: New file.

	* Makefile.am (gen_vc_name_list): Define.  Used to put list
	of recognized version control systems in perldoc output.

	* configure.ac: Version 0.1.1.
	* vc-dwim.pl: Add --print-vc-list option.  Clean up documentation.

	Don't annotate summary lines, and fix a bug.
	* vc-dwim.pl (find_relevant_file): Return a pair.
	(main): Update caller.  Don't add prefix on a summary line.
	(main): Update $offset also when removing leading blank lines.

	* tests/leading-comment: Fix it.

	* vc-dwim.pl (find_relevant_file): Rename from find_parent_file.

2006-09-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/subdir: New file.  Currently expected to fail.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add subdir.

	* vc-dwim.pl: Use $PROCESS_STATUS in place of equivalent code.

	Autoconfiscate, Automakify, and add tests.
	* vc-dwim.pl: Set @INC.  Use @PERL@.

	* ProcessStatus.pm, Coda.pm: New files.

	* vc-dwim.pl: Rename from vc-dwim.
	* vc-dwim: Rename to vc-dwim.pl.

	* vc-dwim: Put documentation in perldoc format.
	Make $VERSION substitutable.

	* vc-dwim (main): Adjust $offset to reflect removal of two lines.
	Depend on Coda.pm and ProcessStatus.pm being in the directory alongside
	this script.
	(main): Add a colon after $file, in the constructed "*"-line.
	(find_parent_file): If the "*" line looks like "* file_name:", don't
	return the ":" as part of the extracted file name.
	(main): Push log file lines onto @log_msg_lines list only *after*
	they might be modified by the find_parent_file()-using code.
	Fix some ?: regexp modifiers that were written as :?.

2006-09-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* vc-dwim: Rename from cvci.
	* cvci: Rename to vc-dwim cvci.
	(main): Tighten up a regexp.
	Add FIXME comment.

2006-09-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* cvci (verbose_cmd): New function.  For consistent verbose output.
	(get_diffs): Use 4+-arg form of open, to avoid quoting problems.

	Allow the user to specify VC manually, in case s/he is using more
	than one (e.g., CVS + RCS).
	* cvci: Implement this, via new --vc=VC_NAME option.
	(usage): Document --vc=VC_NAME.

	* cvci (main): Use a more accurate regexp for +++/--- diff lines.
	Don't print log-summary or diff output unless everything is ok.
	Don't require the existence of a file if it's marked for deletion.
	On the contrary, require its *non*-existence.
	(vc_name): Return undef, rather than 'unknown'.
	(main): Make the code to handle non-'*'-prefixed lines work again.

	* cvci: Use git-diff, not cg-diff, since I don't like being forced
	to use a pager.

	* cvci: New option: --diff.

	* cvci (main): Use a non-greedy (shy) ".*", in case there are two
	or more ":"s on a "*" line.
	E.g., the new-option line, above.

2006-08-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* cvci (main): Handle a diff reflecting an hg-added file.

2006-08-29  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* cvci (HG, CG, CVS, SVN): Factor out constant names of the version
	control systems we know about.
	Ensure that each affected file is mentioned in @$diff_lines
	Thus, if a new file is listed in a ChangeLog entry, but not e.g.,
	"hg add"ed, this will catch the error.  Another explanation: a typo,
	in case you manually (mis)typed the file name in the ChangeLog.

	* cvci (change_log_line_extract_file_list): New function.
	(main): Handle multiple, comma-separated file names per "*"-
	ChangeLog line.

2006-08-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* cvci (main): Work once again when the first added line is blank.
	(main): Remove the first line, if it is blank.
	Fix a couple of other minor bugs.
	(main): New function.

2006-08-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Work when the first added ChangeLog line doesn't start with '*'.
	* cvci (get_new_changelog_lines): Allow removed ChangeLog lines.
	(get_new_changelog_lines): Update to handle offsets.
	(get_new_changelog_lines): Push offset only once per @@ marker.

	* cvci (get_new_changelog_lines): Rewrite to use get_diffs().
	(exists_editor_backup): Work also for files not in ".".

	* cvci: Add svn.

2006-08-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* cvci (get_new_changelog_lines): Work better for hg.
	(vc_name): Remove debugging cruft.

	* cvci (vc_name): New function.
	(main): Use it.

2006-08-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* cvci (get_new_changelog_lines): Don't require 2nd "@@"
	to be at the end of line.  With hg diff -p, it's not.

	* cvci: Add hg support, fix cg commit command.
	Really check in yesterday's change.
	Unlink message file only after the commit command.

2006-08-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* cvci: Now, works for cogito/git, too.
	* cvci: Clean up.  Detect unsaved temps of the affected files, too,
	not just of the ChangeLogs.
