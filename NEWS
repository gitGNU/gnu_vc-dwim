* Noteworthy changes in release ?.? (????-??-??) [?]

  vc-dwim now commits the symlink'd ChangeLog *after* the primary commit,
  not before it.  This is more useful because the primary one is far more
  likely to fail, e.g., due to a commit hook.  Now, when that happens, the
  ChangeLog delta is left uncommitted, as you probably require, so that you
  can run vc-dwim after correcting the problem with the primary commit.


* Noteworthy changes in release 1.2 (2009-09-08) [stable]

  vc-dwim no longer occasionally inserts a "SCALAR(0x...)" line into
  the commit log message.

  vc-chlog now detects removed files in a git tree.

  vc-chlog accepts a --no-functions option to disable identifier extraction.


* Noteworthy changes in release 1.1 (2009-06-20) [stable]

  vc-dwim supports bzr.

  A xz tarball is provided instead of an lzma one.

  A texinfo manual is provided.


* Major changes in release 1.0 (2007-10-11)

  vc-dwim no longer relies on cg (cogito)

  vc-dwim accepts the new option: --author='User Name <user@example.org>'

  vc-dwim automatically attributes (via git-commit's --author option)
  changes written by someone else.

  vc-chlog now has heuristics for matching the end of functions.

* Major changes in release 0.2.2 (2006-11-10)
