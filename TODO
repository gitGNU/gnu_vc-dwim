Update the bug-report-to address in the documentation.

Add a "make distcheck" rule that does something like this:
# FIXME: rather than "hg clone . dst", use checkout-dot NEW_DEST_DIR
tmp = $(TMPDIR)/vc-dwim-$$$$
some_check_hook:
	rm -rf $(tmp)
	hg clone . $(tmp)
	cd $(tmp)
	aclocal && autoheader && automake && autoconf && ./configure
	make distcheck

# FIXME: Provide a way to work when ChangeLog isn't version-controlled.
# E.g., allow ChangeLog to be a not-version-controlled symlink to a
# version controlled ChangeLog in some other hierarchy, possibly using
# a different program for version control.

# FIXME: Optional: warn if there are modified files not listed in ChangeLogs
# FIXME: Add an option to make --commit fail if this is the case.

# FIXME: Maybe add an option to put the user in an editor, starting with our
# slightly formatted ChangeLog-derived log entry.

# FIXME: doesn't honor any of the $CVSROOT, $GIT*, etc. envvars.  Should it?

# FIXME: Rework --vc=VC_NAME support so it works with VC.pm.
# FIXME: rename VC.pm, e.g., to XX::VC.pm.

# FIXME: Consider using only the first, non-"*" ChangeLog line(s)
# as the log message.

# FIXME: Add support for SVK, bzr, monotone, etc.
# FIXME: RCS is a pain because its commit log contents must come via -m'...'
# on the command line.
